You can add the theme directly from within the WP Admin, using the "Upload Theme" option. From Admin Panel go the following path Appearance > Themes > Add New > Upload Theme and select the appropriate zipped theme file, then click Install Now. If your server is not set up properly or you have any problem, you'll have to extract and then upload the theme manually. Using your favorite FTP client tool upload the theme folder into the folder path /wp-content/themes/ on your server and activate it from the admin panel.
Note: On your WordPress site, the wp-content/themes folder has all your themes. Each theme you install gets its own subfolder. All of the theme's stylesheets and template files reside inside the theme's folder.
